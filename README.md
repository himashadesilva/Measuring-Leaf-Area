# Measuring-Leaf-Area

First you should capture the leaf from camera or load a photo of the leaf from gallery and upload it to the server, then it will give the area of the leaf. 

For this,

1. You should take the picture as in example.jpeg . colored 1cm*1cm square along with the leaf.  

2. You should have a server that running upload.php , use XAMPP (https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) or Wamp (http://www.wampserver.com/en/). create a folder name upload in the server and put upload.php file into it.

3. Create matlab executable file of fnfinal.m . for this you should have matlab compiler (http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/). Then try mcc -m fnfinal.m . It will create fnfinal.exe. place it in upload folder.
